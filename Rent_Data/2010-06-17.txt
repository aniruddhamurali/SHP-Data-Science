That&#39; s more difficult 11 because of the vacancy decontrol provision in  the 12 laws. You know , when owners get the legal 13 regulated rent up to $ 2 , 000 and the apartment 14 becomes vacant , they can take it out of  rent 15 stabilization.16 And I can attest to the  fact 17 that owners throughout the City do everything  that 18 they possibly can to get rents to that   threshold 19 including fraudulent MCI increases and 1 / 40 th 20 increases, trying to get very high turnover  rates 21 in the apartments, bringing in people that  they 22 know will only stay there for a short time   and 23 then sort of try to push them out so they   can 24 collect vacancy bonuses, and coming to the RGB  and 25 asking for very high rent  increases.2 </td>
