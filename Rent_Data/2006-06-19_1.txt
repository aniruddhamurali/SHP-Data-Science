And people were asked to register if16 they wanted to.	And I&#39;d like to read some rules17 here.18 But just to be clear, there is19 another hearing being held on the proposed rent20 adjustments being held on June 22nd at the Great21 Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7th Street from22 scheduled to go from ten a.m. to six p.m. ,23 pre-registration to speak at this hearing ending24 at 1 p.m. on June - - the day before Wednesday,25 June 22nd.6 </td>

Please review and get any12 comments to the staff by the morning of June 13	26th.14 As you know, we&#39;re under mandate to15 be simultaneous with our adoption to adopt16 Explanatory Statements and Findings.17 As to financial disclosure, once18 again, delayed.	We should have a financial19 disclosure form package for you in time for the20 June 27th vote.21 In terms of the hearing, I can make22 a couple of statements so that people are clear23 on the rules.24 Particularly as to pre-registration,25 I don&#39;t know if we have anybody who&#39;s in the14 </td>

I actually think that something	I17 realize your guidelines have come up with a18 bracket of eight and a half percent.	I would19 hope that you would come near that.	Ten percent20 would be ideal. 2122 I mean if you think about it, I23 don&#39;t think I could ever get that, but - - and it24 would be a burden on some of the tenants.
