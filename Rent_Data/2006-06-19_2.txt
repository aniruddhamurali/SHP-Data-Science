In14 2002, sixty percent of SRO tenants paid more than15 fifty percent of their income for rent.16 Currently we have some tenants here.17 And in addition to that I am also working with18 two tenants who, one of them is making $1,100 a19 month and is paying $850 a month for rent which20 leaves him with $250 just to fend for himself, as21 well as maybe to take care of his family if he22 has someone living with him.23 I&#39;m asking the Board on behalf of24 this specific group to reconsider the increases25 that you are thinking of adding to the SRO units.12 </td>

That14 is a permanent increase that never comes out of15 the rent and it compounds when the Rent16 Guidelines Board comes up with these increases17 every year.18 In addition to that, it turns out19 that our roof is in need of repair.	Luckily the20 landlord did a smart thing, he got a Section 821 loan which fortunately for tenants there is no22 rent increase.

And we&#39;ve really done some10 tremendous things through the churches and the11 government working very hard together to bring12 back the Bronx.13 We had the fires in the 70s.	People14 were living in shelters in the 80s.	And it was a15 tremendous - - Koch was the Mayor at the time I16 believe and the churches all got together and the17 government and we built - - rebuilt the Bronx for18 the people who are now living in it to the folks19 that are not with very high incomes.20 And I just was looking around my21 parish, which is 182nd Street and Crotona.	And a22 block away they&#39;re putting up a building that23 it&#39;s - - they call it a condominium apartment,24 it&#39;s going to $310, 000 for a three-bedroom and25 $290,000 for one-bedroom.

I have seen a lot of my11 people go away so it&#39;s breaking up the parishes.12 I want to talk a little bit about13 some - - a system which I thought was a great,14 great system was the Section 8 system.	When it15 was community- based it worked.	And then it got16 weakened by this voucher system that came out.17 And in the voucher system when a18 vacant apartment came up, the landlord could just19 get rid of it and then he could put it at market20 price and raise his price.	In fact, in some21 cases he would work so that that man or woman or22 whoever was in that apartment would get out of23 the apartment then he could use it the way he24 wanted to.25 What I think is we should get back2 </td>
