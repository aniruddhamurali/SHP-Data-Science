These 3 gatekeepers are the private citizens that the  City 4 has inequitably forced to shoulder the public  cost 5 with higher real estate taxes, another  upcoming 6 increase in water and sewer charges, and dozens  of 7 administrative fees.8 The tenants must share in  these 9 costs. The rent stabilized apartment is not a  birth 10 right. The obligations of being a good  tenant 11 include paying a rent that fairly reflects the  cost 12 of running safe, habitable and affordable  housing.13 Last year&#39; s RGB order, the prior 14 year, Order 40 and 41 , which called for 15 supplemental increases on tenants paying under  a16 thousand dollars per month on apartments they&#39; ve 17 lived in for six years or more, was  effectively 18 taken off the table by the court. That  supplemental 19 rent increase was passed by this board as  a20 necessary assist to landlords struggling in  the 21 face of skyrocketing fuel cost and real estate  tax 22 increases.23 Much discussion and deliberation 24 went into addressing the challenge facing  those 25 landlords who are subsidizing long- term, low- rent 2 </td>

It was an imperfect solution but  it 4 addressed a specific and realistic problem.  And 5 without such assistance, the struggle to keep  their 6 properties in good repair was further  challenged.7 This is most important as the  rate 8 of distressed apartment properties increasing 9 because operating expenses rise faster than  rents 10 in some buildings. Low rents means small  monthly 11 increases, which might not be a troublesome  issue.12 However, expenses tend to rise higher and  faster 13 per apartment than the small monthly rent  increases 14 on low- rent apartments.15 And expenses are rising fast,  very 16 fast. Our staff reports are thorough. But  this 17 year&#39; s reported operating cost price increases 18 understates the rise in fuel oil prices  and 19 overstates the decrease in gas heating prices,  with 20 the overall effect of grossly understating  the 21 general rise in operating cost increases.
