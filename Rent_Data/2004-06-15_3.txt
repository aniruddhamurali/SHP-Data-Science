Twenty14 percent is the statutory standard. So they  are15 getting more than that.16 Whereas in the outer boroughs17 the average increase upon vacancy is about  eight18 percent.19 What does that mean? It means  on20 average the rents in the outer boroughs are  close21 to market , but on average the apartments in22 Manhattan  are not , upon vacancy  anyway.23 So there are all kinds of24 supplements you can add to the outer  boroughs25 which really don&#39; t apply to the Manhattan  market  .6 </td>

At that meeting  the14 rent range was sprung upon the group. It  took15 everyone off - guard and was bulldozed through as16 far as I could see to everyone&#39; s confusion and17 surprise.18 And the low end of this  range19 was set higher than was  expected.20 In the words of The New  York21 Times the next day, quote, for most of the  last22 decade rents for stabilized apartments have  gone23 up a few percentage points in keeping with   low24 inflation and to a lesser degree with  annual25 surveys measuring	landlord costs and incomes,10 </td>

My own building , with10 approximately ninety rent stabilized units out  of11 450 , is two years old. There are no lead paint12 hazards.

Further evidence of the4 crisis of affordability points to the  high5 eviction rates and increasing levels of  non-6 payment petit ion filings.7 Specifically, more than 230, 0008 households in New York City have been evicted   in9 the last ten years.10 In short ,  these  rent increases11 have played and continue to play a crucial   role12 in making New York City the most  unaffordable13 place to live in this  country.14 If you look at the Rent15 Guidelines Board&#39; s mortgage  survey, interest16 rates obviously were at an all - time low. As a17 result of this occurrence, many landlords saw   the18 benefits of these low- interest rates and took19 advantage by applying for new loans  and20 refinancing their mortgages.

And  the issue that  - - maybe one of  the16 things that needs to be done with the rezoning   is17 as we go through it , is that there be deed18 restrictions, either, or regulatory agreements,19 because many of those projects will not be  built20 for many years.21 COUNCILMEMBER  CHRISTINE QUINN:22 Right , right.23 MR.

That &#39;s10 why the Rent Stabilization Law was  passed.11 (Audience part icipation.)12 MR.

If half of the people  are22 suffering, that &#39;s not a very good pass rate.23 And I also want to remind  you24 that for fifty years that figure was twenty- five25 percent , not to speak of the old , of the recently2 </td>
