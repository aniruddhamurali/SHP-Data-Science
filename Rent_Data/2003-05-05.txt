PAGAN:	Mr. Chair, I just4wanttorespondto Mr. Lubell .5(Audience part icipat ion. )6MR. PAGAN:	Yes, this ten7 percent goes to the tenant. But the idea  of8 having the sublet and adding ten percent here  and9 five percent there, $20 here, $20 there,  suddenly10 we are looking at rents that are skyrocketing  and11 moving out and being unaffordabl e.12 The idea here is to be able  to13 allow persons who leave for a short period  of14 t ime from their home without the fear of losing15 the apartment and at the same t ime ensuring that16 their rent for that apartment is  paid.17 The tenant is still responsible18 for that rent if their sublett ing doesn&#39; t pay it .19 It &#39; s not where - - sure he&#39; s getting someone else20 that &#39; s paying it , but if that person doesn&#39; t pay,21 the tenant is going to have to respond or  lose22 the apartment .23 So I just don&#39; t see why we need24 to keep on hitting people for  additional25 percentages when there is no need in this  case.7 </td>

PAGAN:	Mr. Chairman, I&#39;ve4 been here seven or eight years and every year  the5 same poor tax comes up. And I call it a poor  tax6 because it hits the people who least are able  to7 afford it.8 In many cases the reason the9 rents are below $500 is because the  market10 doesn&#39; t allow it to increase above $500. People11 in those neighborhoods cannot pay for it. I  don&#39;t12 believe there are too many places in  Manhattan13 below 96th Street where this poor tax will  apply.14 It would probably apply to peopl e in the outer15 boroughs more than it would be  local.16 The biggest probl em I have is17 that we have just passed a 5.5 and an  8.518 percent , and I&#39;m repeating that. But this one19 woul d probably hit the people with a larger20 increase than a 5.5 and 8.5 . And when you put it21 together, some people would be hit with 20, a  2522 percent increase.23 And this is without  considering24 what other action we may take tonight or at  the25 final vote.

But we3 heard test imony over the years, people who are4 paying  $600, $700 ,  $800 for a loft , 2000 square5 feet of space in Soho. If it weren&#39; t controlled6 by rent stabilization, they would be paying  maybe7 a hundred times more. Certainly the value  of8 those units is so enormous, plus there are  costs.9 They may be providing  services,10 but they don&#39; t pay the taxes. They don&#39; t pay for11 the insurance. And these are costs that the  loft12 owners actually have to pay.13 But  this is valuable  space . Most14 of those loft tenants have had a boon for  years.15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Okay .16 Any additional debate?17 (No response. )18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the19 question.20 This is for a zero rent  increase21 for the loft sector.22 Ms. Adams?23 MS.

So I would18 just hope this Board would take that  into19 consideration.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Second?21 MR.
