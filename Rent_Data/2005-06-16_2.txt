This hemorrhage in the loss of affordabl e6 housing seriously affects the City&#39; s ability  to7 attract new workers such as teachers and   other8 City workers.9	It is estimated that there  are10 only about 50,000 rent controlled units left  in11 the City. This special guideline not only   helps12 remove vacat ed units from rent regulation, it13 also adversely affects the remaining  rent14 controlled tenants.15 By increasing high rental  market16 rate apartments the assessed value and taxes  of17 the building are increased. And this forms  a18 major component in the Maximum Base Rent   increase19 for rent controlled  apartments.20 The last MBR increase for  2004-21 2005 was 17.2 percent , the highest in twenty-22 eight years.
