When I made this purchase, I had  one 17 goal in mind, to provide safe, affordable  housing 18 to New York City residents.	This just is 19 impossible, however.20 Eleven units are rent stabilized 21 and one unit is rent controlled.	One- third of my 22 buildings pays less than a thousand dollar  per 23 month in rent.	I don&#39; t have the cash to operate 24 the building much less make a living for  myself.25 ( Audience participation.)2 </td>

ADRIENNE KNIGHTT:	This year 3 has been the perfect storm of operating  cost 4 increases because everything has been increasing  at 5 once.6 Electricity, water, insurance,7 taxes, you name it, it all went up this  year.8 Since I bought the building in 2005 , I have  been 9 operating in the red.	But now I&#39; m really concerned 10 that I will lose my  building.11 I&#39; m sure you heard here tonight 12 the single biggest factor in my increase  in 13 operating costs has been the ballooning  fuel 14 prices.15 In 2005 the cost of fuel in  my 16 building was twenty thousand dollars.	This past 17 winter was a much different story. I paid $ 29 , 000 18 in fuel bills.	One tenant pays just $ 327 per month 19 in rent.	This means that what this tenant pays  for 20 the entire year won&#39; t cover the fuel cost and 21 utilities for even one month.22 A minimum rent adjustment for 23 tenants like this would help. It won&#39; t solve my 24 cash flow problem but it will take, you know --   I25 will take all the help I can  get.2 </td>

They have been taking a8 survey over the past decade of New Yorkers  and 9 food. Amazingly enough, 3 . 1 million New Yorkers 10 responded to their survey that last year they  were 11 worried at some point about putting food on  their 12 family&#39; s table.	That&#39; s an extraordinary,13 extraordinary statistic.14 Almost half of New Yorkers  were 15 worried at some point last year they couldn&#39; t  put 16 food on the table and it&#39; s no wonder why.

Not at all.  I&#39; ve 17 met bad landlords. I&#39; ve sued bad landlords but I&#39; ve 18 also met a lot of landlords who cared deeply  about 19 their tenants.20 But it&#39; s time that we realize that 21 as this City, we are all in this together.

It&#39; s11 actually a conservative number.	It&#39; s more than 12 that.	Three hundred and fifty percent came  because 13 they deregulated virtually every unit in  the 14 building.

But I am asking all of you on the   Board 3 to at least do a reversal and give the  lowest 4 percentage rate for a one- year lease and two- year 5 lease this year.
