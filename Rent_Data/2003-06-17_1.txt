Ongoing construction at  The4 Commander has severely changed the building&#39; s5 conf iguration. Eighteen of the two hundred and6 eighty SRO units were demolished without  a7 Cert ificate of Non- Harassment or proper permits8 from governmental agencies.9 The landlord has evicted more10 than half of the rent stabilized tenants in   order11 to deregulate units and is now charging  between12 $1400 and $1550 and $4200 a month for units  that13 had previously ranged from $300 to $500 a mont h.14 See the cover sheet.15 Unfortunat ely, not all the prices are on it.16 It is obvious that a rent17 increase is not warranted for the few  remaining18 rent regulated tenants who are in a category  of19 unemployed , underemployed  and senior citizens20 residing at The Commander- Tempo Hotel.21 One of the Board Members  stated22 during a public meeting that salaries for  SRO23 tenants had risen. This is, and I feel  and24 personally know, this is the misstat ement of  the25 year.2 </td>

        <td id="LC8" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">2 I work with tenants seven days  a3 week. In SROs and hotels there is a high rate  of4 unemployed tenants. Of course, those tenants  who5 are moving into the new, decontrolled units  do6 have a much higher income. Unfortunately,  that7 Board Member neglected to report or  mention8 profits obtained by hotel  owners.9 The Board is considering10 granting a rent increase to SRO and  residential11 hotel tenants based on test imony of only one12 creditable SRO landlord and a few others who  may13 have fraudulently responded to a  questionnaire14 that was distributed.15 Today, you will be hearing16 honest testimony from those that are the &quot; have17 nots&quot; in society.18 An increase in rent would be  a19 severe injustice to all SRO and hotel tenants.

ADAMS :	Within our powers as4 they presently are, is there anything else  that5 you can think of that this Board should be  doing6 with regard to SROs?7	MS. ANNE CUNNINGHAM :	Well,8 what  I think  - - and you did ask that during  one9 of the public meet ings .10 I think it &#39;s very, very11 necessary to keep in mind that the older  SRO12 tenants and hotel tenants do not have  any13 protections.14 When I moved into the hotel,  I15 was charged six months City and State tax,  and16 after six months it was given back to me. I  do17 not have a lease . Many of us at my age do not18 have leases . Leases were given out in 1982 or  so19 and, of course, they are never  renewed.20 Another thing that you  could21 take into consideration, there are very  few22 tenants left in this  category, particularly	in23 the Class A hotels . It &#39;s very easy to monitor and24 find out how many tenants are living there, long -25 term tenants.8 </td>

What  is7 happening when there is construction,  the8 landlords move tenants around. I have  told9 tenants don&#39; t leave your room because you lose10 your rights. When they leave their room,  they11 lose their rights and they&#39;re moved to  another12 room because then they do get a  preferential13 rent . And that rent is registered as $2100 or14 $1700 even though they may be paying $500  a15 month. They&#39;re in a very precarious  position.16 But you must take into17 consideration that they&#39; re very poor people and18 they must keep their homes.19 Thank you.20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.21 The next speaker is  Helen22 Maurizio.23 MS.

While there15 are some properties who can take advantage of  the16 increase, there are those that are unable to  and17 have been unable to for many years. Therefore,  we18 ask that you remove the proviso or at least  alter19 it to enable the SROs to take advantage of  the20 increase.21 May I suggest that we  try22 eliminating the proviso and see what results   can23 be achieved by next year?

It was a 500 - unit building with about 40022 rent stabilized tenants when I started in   1987.23 Today we have about forty tenants left in  that24 building.

They, like all rational16 economic actors, tend to economize. And that  sort17 of neutral sounding phrase in this case  means18 they cut back on services . They cut back on19 maintenance  of their buildings.20 And where they can, they  attempt21 to replace existing moderate rent paying  tenants22 with much higher rent paying  tenants.23 And in many cases they  are24 successful even in areas where you would  not25 expect that , such as Central Harlem.

But17 landlords use less of these units. If a  price18 goes up , do we buy more, do we buy less, do we19 buy as much? It depends on our budget.  Everyone20 says budgets are tight. So we buy  less.21 Landlords&#39; costs, as far  as22 labor goes, have actually gone down. But yet  we23 are assuming they have gone up.

Yet4 historically, the Rent Guidelines Board has  given5 more weight and credibility to the plight  and6 profit margins of landlords rather than to  the7 plight and living costs of our  tenants.8 Never has the Rent  Guidelines9 Board declared a rent decrease, nor has it  ever10 declared a rent freeze.11 Often, high fuel costs have  led12 this Board to increase rents at a very  high13 percentage. Moreover, even last year when  the14 Price Index of Operating Costs decreased,  the15 Rent Guidelines Board raised the rents by  two16 percent for a one-year lease and four percent   for17 two-year leases.18 I ask that this Board  consider19 other factors including the stock of  affordable20 housing and owner income and  profits.21 I am also very supportive of  the22 City Council having a voice in the selection of  a23 Board Member.24 (Audience participation.)25 PUBLIC ADVOCATE BETSY  GOTBAUM:2 </td>
