The City5 charges more for publ ic housing. And as one of6 the earlier speakers said , people in these7 apartments are not poor and they are not  not8 working. They are couples, professional  working9 couples, paying $523 for a one- bedroom apartment10 on 80th Street on the Upper West  Side.11 For years I&#39;ve managed  to12 support these low rents with my own salary  and13 income from the other four units, which  have14 experienced recently in the last ten years  the15 normal turnover and  increases.16 I figured if I waited long17 enough, I would get back an apartment every  five18 years. That was okay as long as costs also  went19 up gradually. But just in the last two years,  my20 taxes jumped almost $6 , 000, that &#39;s thirty- three21 percent , my gas heat and electric bills22 skyrocketed.23 Here are my bills.

There&#39; s been a fifteen5 percent decline of the African- American6 population in the neighborhood.  So it has been7 replaced by upscale corporate culture, yup  people8 and it has really destroyed the  neighborhood.9 The high rents - - on a  daily10 basis at GOLE and other agencies we are  bombarded11 by people coming with non- payment petitions,12 holdover protections. And often these  are13 frivolous litigation. Another  form of harassment14 is to litigat e a tenant until they are exhausted.15 And senior citizens on fixed incomes are  deprived16 of services. And it doesn&#39; t take much to harass  a17 senior citizen. Sometimes you just have to  hang18 up on a senior citizen and the blood  pressure19 goes up and they end up in the hospital and , you20 know, it cannot be documented what has  happened.21 So I want to emphasize there&#39; s22 serious harassment going on in the neighborhood23 to get the low- income tenants out to accommodate24 high rents for landlords who are making a lot   of25 money .2 </td>

Aided by17 City and State government , MetLife created an18 affordable housing community, praised  for its19 inspired urban planning.20 The opportunities offered  by21 affordable housing helped renew and rebuild  New22 York City after the end of World War II.

That &#39;s very nice. But how is16 he going to replace the one million  apartments17 that are slipping away now .18 Between the rent increases that19 you keep piling on and the vacancy decont rol that20 we see now and the kind of incent ive - -  the21 environment	is one of tremendous incent ive for22 landlords to push people out and push for  that23 vacancy decontrol .
