Now, Chairman, you should know  that15 also means that the right of automatic  lease16 renewal is removed as a right of the  tenant17 thereby giving owners complete control of  all18 housing units in this City at $2000 or more   rent.19 Since 1994, more than  100,00020 apartments in New York City have been  deregulated21 due to high- rent and high- income vacancy22 decontrol.

MARKOWITZ:5 Well, you are  - -  I could not agree with you  more6 in terms of the fact that there used to be  a7 State program. When I was elected as a  Senator,8 it was already history. And that was called  the9 Mitchell - Lama program.10 And the Mitchell - Lama program11 was the most innovative national housing  program12 in America. Regrettably over the  last13 twenty/twenty- five years the State of New York14 has put affordable housing way in the back  of15 priorities rather than to the front.16 And this we all share, we  share17 as elected officials, we share in the  private18 sector. You&#39;re right. The real answer to  the19 housing crisis is more affordabl e housing.20 If we can - - in fact , my mother21 told me that right after World War II there was   a22 time when building owners would offer  a23 thirt eenth month free or a chandelier and wall -24 to-wall carpeting to encourage tenants to  move25 into their buildings.2 </td>

Increases of 8.5  percent19 for those who choose a two- year lease won&#39; t cover20 last year&#39;s increases nor will they cover  your21 staff&#39; s projection for next year&#39;s increases.22 And about a third of  tenants23 won&#39; t have leases expiring under Guideline 35.24 They get pretty much a free  ride.25 I don&#39; t know if you appreciate8 </td>
