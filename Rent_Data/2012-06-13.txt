MC LAUGHLIN:	The reason why5 we haven&#39; t done it in Staten Island is only  one6 percent of all the stabilized apartments  actually7 are in Staten Island.	So by holding the hearing8 there, we really wouldn&#39; t make it available to9 everybody else in the City.10 So that -- that&#39; s the reason.11 It&#39; s just the number of units are so low holding  it12 in Staten Island we would -- we -- the fear is   that13 we just would not get a good  turnout.14 MR. STANFORD:	But you can try.15 Because, after all, Staten Island is,  officially,16 in your borough but, technically, it&#39; s a New Jersey17 borough.	You&#39; re treating Staten Island like a18 forgotten borough just like the MTA.19 And I said this before,  dealing20 with the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, it&#39; s21 like dealing with the MTA  board members.	I mean,22 both teams are absentminded and inconsiderate  and23 not showing any concern for us.	MTA board members24 are constantly electing fare and toll  increases,25 you&#39; re constantly electing rent increases.2 </td>

The average income for5 apartment, according to the RGB studies is $ 1 , 1716 and that has to be measured against the cost  of7 actually providing that apartment, not simply  just8 the operating expenses which RGB reflects in  the9 PIOC.10 As an example, the RGB  calculates11 that net operating income is about 32 percent  of12 gross income but from that 32 percent the  owner13 must pay about another 20 percent for debt  service,14 another 5 percent for capital improvements  and15 another 10 percent for the operating costs that  the16 RGB doesn&#39; t recognize.17 It&#39; s an unsustainable financial18 model because when you add in all those  other19 expenses, many buildings actually end up in  deficit20 and there&#39; s not an operating surplus.21 And note, also, that this problem22 is unrelated to debt service costs.

Today more than3 40 percent of the tenants in the building  have4 lived there 15 years or more.	This number includes5 only two rent controlled apartments.	The average6 rent for these long- term stabilized tenants is7 $ 808 . 75 or 26 percent less than the average rent.8 These tenants don&#39; t cover the9 proportionate cost of running a building.	Rather,10 they are being subsidized by the newcomers to  the11 building who are paying market rents,  mostly12 preferential rents.	And without passing a minimum13 increase this year of at least $ 65 for a one- year14 lease and $ 95 for a two- year lease, these tenants15 will fall further behind.16 This calendar year the real estate17 taxes in the building are approximately $ 123 , 400 or18 $ 2 , 572 per apartment.	In the previous year, the19 real estate taxes in this building were  about20 $ 115 , 100 or $ 2 , 398 per apartment.	The difference21 one year over the other, reflected a 7 . 22 percent22 increase, which is about $ 8 , 300 or $ 173 per23 apartment.

I&#39; m glad you asked4 it.5 I -- I think what happened --  I6 mean, there was, obviously, a lot of  confusion7 around Orders 40 and 41 which -- where a stay   was8 issued on the Order and owners could not  collect9 it.	So, you know, some owners collected some   of10 it.	Some owners didn&#39; t collect, depending on  when11 your lease came up during that  period.12 If they did collect it,  owners13 ended up refunding it, as Nick Petras  just14 indicated, which was a complicated and a  costly15 affair. And, you know, if you didn&#39; t do it,  you16 were potentially subject to over -- rent  overcharge17 complaints.18 But, I think, what&#39; s most19 interesting about this is that even if  you20 collected the minimum rent increases under  Orders21 40 and 41 , you still have low rents.	I mean, we22 have a situation where you&#39; ve got about -- you23 still have about 17 percent of the housing  stock,24 about 100 and -- more than 166 , 000 units of housing25 that rent for less than $ 800 a month.

And I think we should understand  by15 when we say a minimum rent increase, a   minimum16 dollar increase, we&#39; re talking just about a,17 essentially, a few dollars more than what  the18 guideline increase would be.19 So, for instance, if you had a  two20 -- end up with a two percent increase on a  $ 60021 rent, you know, it&#39; s $ 12 so that a $ 20 minimum of22 that would add another $ 8 to the rent.

Shelter is3 a basic human necessity, but the tenants in  my4 district are telling me stories of having to  cut5 back on other real necessities like food  and6 medicine for themselves and their children in  order7 to keep a roof over their  heads.8 This isn&#39; t good enough for the9 United States.	It isn&#39; t good enough for New York10 City and it isn&#39; t good enough for the people of  the11 Bronx.	New York must remain an affordable City  for12 all of its residents.13 I recognize that small landlord14 owners are feeling the pinch of the  economic15 climate too and I&#39; m prepared to help them weather16 the storm as well but not on the backs of   tenants.17 The fact is that landlord profits are higher  today18 than they were in 1969 . And some purchase their19 buildings at speculative prices with the  intention20 of displacing the tenants and converting  the21 buildings to market rates or luxury  housing.22 Now some of these landlords are23 finding that they don&#39; t have the money to pay  the24 debt service and they&#39; re allowing conditions to25 deteriorate.

With each increase rents get closer to  the6 point of no longer being rent stabilized  and7 converting to market rates.	When that happens, we8 take one more step towards making New York  City9 unaffordable since future tenants and renters  will10 not have the protection of rent stabilization  --11 excuse me, or even basic tenants  rights.12 In the last 30 years New York  City13 has lost almost 200 , 000 rent regulated units.
