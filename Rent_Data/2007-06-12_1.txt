We will have another one16 next week in Queens.17 And in terms of announcements,  there18 really aren&#39;t any.	Just in terms of the - - as I19 said, there will be another public hearing.

In fact, you have5 given landlords such enormous increases over the6 past several decades that it is about time you7 grant a rent freeze.8 When rents are increased to the9 point where people have to spend most of their10 income on rent, they will have less to spend on11 goods and services causing businesses to fail and12 many people will lose their jobs and homes  leading13 to an increase in crime and disease which will14 effect all of us.15 Families will be broken up and16 children will languish in orphanages on a diet of17 gruel.	Affordable apartments have been18 disappearing.	Real wages have been going down and19 my husband is the Medicare doughnut hole.20 Many people in the Simon Senior21 Center are so squeezed financially that their only22 nutrition is the $1.50 lunch and some are in such23 dire straights that the management allows them to24 give a bit less.

CHIP is an association of small5 and medium owners of residential property.6 CHIP is concerned that the proposed7 guidelines do not reflect the economic reality of8 owning property in New York.9	It has been the practice of the10 Board to issue a Price Index of Operating Costs11 and then to retreat significantly from such12 numbers to set the guidelines.	This guarantees13 that the rents will not keep pace with the actual14 cost of operating buildings.15 Specifically the Board&#39;s PIOCs for16 the four years, 2003 through 2007, show an actual17 increase in costs to operating property of forty18 two and a half percent.	The guidelines compounded19 during that same period totaled 15.9 percent.20 This is a staggering mismatch.	Accordingly, the21 guideline&#39;s increase had compensated owners for22 only about one-third of the cost increases over23 the period.24 There&#39;s a practical and measurable25 impact on housing as a result.

And the work is to12 prevent speculative, unwarranted and abnormal13 increases in rents and that conditions exist14 because there&#39;s an acute shortage of dwelling15 units that create a special hardship on persons16 and families occupying rental units.17 And just part of the little18 discussion that was just going on, it&#39;s not the19 individual rents paid by tenants or any particular20 tenant . There are tenants that could afford to21 pay for the space they&#39;re occupying.	It&#39;s the22 rate of return on the building .

So we need to do something to7 look into that discrepancy.8 But that plays up one of our9	provisos we&#39;ve had for years is that hotels are10 not registered with DHCR as required. So that11 might account for some of those missing buildings.12 Again, those other uses that the13 hotel and rooming houses are put to, the transient14 rentals, the college rentals and also to the15 special needs tenants, those are all ways that16 landlords get themselves an adequate rate of17 return and Iwould argue that SROs do not warrant18 an increase.19 My time is up?

There&#39;s been many times where the RGB19 has passed orders in the past that have been20 challenged by tenants or challenged by landlords21 and the Court has upheld it one way or the  other.22 So if there&#39;s - - if it&#39;s ambiguous,23 if you&#39;re not sure whether it&#39;s the code24 enforcement proviso, if there&#39;s rent impairing25 violations, if it&#39;s the proviso around deregulated2 </td>

There are certainly landlords out8 there that need an increase because of their9 expenses.	But there are plenty of landlords,10 large landlords who are making a great rate of11 return if they&#39;re making extreme profits.

I think more analysis needs to be done so18 you can really have a true informed debate of how19 many units are there, 50 percent or more20 deregulated, 20 percent or more deregulated .21 That data is available from DHCR.22 The research done by the Rent Guidelines Board23 with the data they got from DHCR for the hotels,24 was very helpful because it gives us a sense how25 many buildings.2 </td>

Rooming housings run the18 gambit.	There are a lot of rooming houses at19 Chelsea and Harlem.20 In those instances, there&#39;s a lot of21 displacement pressure.

And even when you file5 the Rent Reduction complaints, it&#39;s actually a6 very long and tedious process, as I know from my7 own personal experience.8 There&#39;s also a lot of problems with9 DHCR.	The inspectors come out months after you10 file it.	So if it&#39;s a condition that may be sort11 of sporadic, like, for example, in our building we12 had a problem with the elevator.	We had a lot of13 elderly and disabled tenants in our building and14 actually several of them died and I&#39;m convinced it15 was because the elevator was out so often .16 But every time the inspector would17 come, you know, the elevator would be working for18 a few hours and that would always be the time that19 they would come.	So it took us, I think over a20 year to actually get the reduction for that21 condition.22 So it&#39;s - - all of these things are23 helpful but none of them are guaranteed to really24 give tenants the relief that they need.

The great thing about doing it through you8 is that you can send a notice that every tenant9 gets a lease in theory.	And if the notice comes10 with the lease and they know that they can apply11 to have their rent guidelines increase not imposed12 on them if there&#39;s rent - - sorry, repair problems13 in the building, then every tenant will have that14 notice.15 Nobody - - DHCR doesn&#39;t send a notice16 to every tenant saying oh, by the way, if you &#39;re17 landlord&#39;s not doing repairs, you can file this18 nifty Failure to Maintain Services complaint .

Rent increases authorized by this Board10 have covered less than half of those increased11 costs and costs will continue to rise12 substantially.13 Water and sewer rates are increasing14 in double digits for the foreseeable future and15 electric rates are also projected to increase in16 double digits.17 As a result of inadequate Rent18 Guideline increases, the Board has clear evidence19 that the profitability of affordable housing20 outside core Manhattan is declining.

And because6 the Price Index is lower this year than last, it7 provides an opportunity to compensate for the8 inadequacy of recent Rent Guidelines increases.9 The Board should also incorporate10 into this year&#39;s guidelines, some of the projected11 eight and a half percent increase in costs12 anticipated for next year.13 The RGB has evidence that vacancy14 increases in the deregulation of apartments have a15 negligible effect on rental properties outside16 core Manhattan.	We have only to look at the half17 million apartments still renting for less than18 $850 per month in 2005 with more entering the19 system everyday, to recognize that stabilized20 housing remains broadly affordable.21 The only way that the bulk of this22 City&#39;s affordable housing can be preserved is by23 recognizing that stabilized rents must be24 increased in line with increased building25 operating costs.2 </td>

ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	So it&#39;s not the15 landlord doesn&#39;t have any money because we know16 that he actually own buildings up in Harlem and17 then decided to buy in Chinatown.	And so we know18 that he has a lot of - - he owns a lot of buildings19 and a lot of money and that it&#39;s just that he20 doesn&#39;t want to make the repairs.21 MR. LANGUEDOC:	What, in your22 opinion, would be the reason why the landlord does23 not want to make repairs if, in fact, he has the24 money to make the repairs?25 MR.

And one of the ways4 that he does that is by not providing services.5 And so when he doesn&#39;t provide services and make6 the repairs, then the tenants, they get frustrated7 and it&#39;s easier for them to leave. And so then8 it&#39;s in his interest to do that.9 MR. LANGUEDOC:	And could I just10 say that your the first person that&#39;s come before11 us today who was not speaking English. I&#39;d just12 like to ask you this question.13 Do you feel that there are14 sufficient sources of information for rent15 stabilized tenants who do not speak English as16 their primary language?17 MR . ZHIQUIN ZHEN:	So in terms of18 her experience it&#39;s very, very difficult to find19 out information when you don&#39;t speak English. And20 the landlord actually prays on that. And so like21 things like going to court and getting documents22 from the landlord, it&#39;s extra hard to try to23 figure what it is that the landlord is trying to24 do .25 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.2 </td>

So20 the next time they&#39;ll probably try to submeter the21 water bill .

It looks like it&#39;s6 going to eight-and-a-half.	You know, when you7 take an average of your projected guidelines of8 three-and-a-quarter and 7.75, that&#39;s9	five-and-a-half percent . We really need that for10 a one-year increase and nothing less.11 Now, there&#39;s no reason why we should12 continue to shoulder the bulk of increased13 operating costs and tenants should pay their fair14 share. If you are going to base your decision on15 what tenants can afford, you&#39;re only looking at16 half the picture .17 We can&#39;t absorb more operating costs18 without cutting back on some type of service and19 maintenance.	Now, we&#39;re not looking for a20 windfall and a windfall 50 years from now of $221 million does not make a difference today.	We&#39;re22 looking for the opposite.

They sort of blur17 together in that part of Queens.18 After a recent preliminary meeting19 of this Board, a landlord overheard my talking20 about too high rents and said to me I should just21 leave New York. I was born in New York City and22 where my parents and grandparents and I don&#39;t want23 to leave my home .  As I thought about his comment,24 I realized the many differences between me as a25 tenant and landlords in general.9 </td>

This7 rent is, with the help of DRIE, the Disability8 Rent Increase Exemption and which only took effect9 this month.	My last gas and electric bill was $5910 and change.
