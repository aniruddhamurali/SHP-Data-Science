ROSENBERG:	The rents have4 gone up higher than I could have imagined  across5 the board in general but, basically, it&#39; s only to6 keep pace with the escalating costs of  water,7 double digit water now is just almost $ 1 , 000 an8 apartment per year.	When I started back in  the9 business, it was $ 9 , 000 for a 90 - family house.	Now10 you&#39; re talking $ 100 , 000 .	So the price of water  is11 crazy high.	It&#39; s now one of the major line items.12 And your real estate taxes as13 well.	If the rents that have been increased  so14 steady were without the high cost of water and  all15 its mandates and costs in there, and if the  City16 would give a break to property owners that  have17 stabilized and affordable housing, we would be  able18 to do much better.19 So all those high increases  that20 you hear are really just keeping up, if that,  with21 expenses.22 MR.

I believe our5 report shows about 27 percent but that&#39; s from such6 a low number that maybe it works out to $ 50 a  unit7 on average.	Whereas, expenses start at a  much8 higher number and although they only went up  229 percent, right, starting from a higher number  they10 went up almost $ 100 .11 So, I guess, this underscores  what12 you just said about the -- the expenses just  barely13 keeping up with the rate of NOI  increases.14 MR.

In Manhattan, the SRO units are  cheaper5 to run on a square foot basis because you  have6 shared bathrooms, shared kitchens.	They&#39; re more7 profitable on a square foot  basis.8 You just look at these rents.9 Even the actual rents collected or the  preferential10 rents, they are sky high.	And I don&#39; t know how11 they even got this high when you have had  zero12 increases or increases with provisos. The data  from13 those prior memos also show that somewhere  between14 the majority and the vast majority of  buildings15 would not qualify for a guideline because of  these16 provisos.17 So I would argue, you know,  going18 up to 90 percent means that fewer buildings  would19 qualify.

The second page is  a6 photo of it in its present state in Brooklyn  and,7 also, the hallways.8 This building has served about9 four generations of tenants and with adequate  rent10 increases in the future, hopefully, it can  serve11 another four generations of tenants.	It was here12 before I was born and it will probably be  here13 after I&#39; m gone.14 It was stated on the -- on  the15 next page, an analysis, it was stated at the  May16 1 st hearing that rents had gone up in stabilized17 units by 5 . 5 percent or $ 2 , 200 per year per tenant.18 And I just have to take exception  to that.

Tenant D is a4 rent controlled tenant.5 And the primary point I wish  to6 make is that the average stabilized rent  increases7 over 11 years has been about 3 percent and by   the8 more exacting rent control formulas administered  by9 the State, they&#39; ve been 5 . 5 percent.10 So the magnitude of the  increases11 under rent control have been more in line with  what12 an owner needs to keep up with  cost increases.	The13 cumulative monthly increases on the  stabilized14 units of less than $ 200 over 11 years is  just15 minimal and inadequate.16 Finally, my last handout is17 something from a non- profit organization in18 Brooklyn in a local paper where they were  offering19 one- bedroom apartments for $ 925 a month for20 relatively low income tenants.	And what I&#39; m asking21 today is that for those low rent apartments in  the22 rent stabilized inventory, that we also be given  a23 fixed dollar amount in this guideline to  come24 closer to the rent control increases over the  last25 11 years.2 </td>

They must not be interested in the  very21 harsh provisos that if we -- if you use  those22 provisos in the apartment buildings, it  would23 become a huge uproar where we have provisos of  8024 percent of requirements -- 95 percent but we do  not25 hear from SRO owners.2 </td>

That&#39; s when we get6 started.	I&#39; m not saying that that is a primary7 issue for many owners today, it&#39; s an issue for8 tenants and an issue for owners.	But that&#39; s not9 how we -- that&#39; s how we got started.10 So right now what we&#39; re focusing11 on is the need to provide quality housing for  the12 tenants who are in our buildings or in  the13 buildings here in New York City.	And so what14 owners are saying for, please help us provide  the15 quality that we want to provide.	But in order to16 provide that quality, we must secure rents  that17 will enable us to do so.	And so the percentages18 that are being asked to today, will not  enable19 owners to do that.20 And what we don&#39; t want to see are21 owners going out of business and owners keeping  --22 keeping apartments vacant because they are  afraid23 because of how the system is set up with having   to24 assume all the legal costs, the court costs and  all25 the other costs associated with property  ownership.2 </td>

HOLDER:	Ms. Cunningham,5 thank you for your testimony.	I appreciate it.6 Just a quick question, I know  that7 you&#39; ve been an advocate for many, many years and I8 know that you&#39; re working with Councilwoman Brewer.9 Could you tell me or could  you10 explain to us what you&#39; ve seen in terms of  the11 change and the type of assistance that people  have12 come to -- can you quantify or even distinguish  the13 types of services that people have been asking  you14 for?15 MS. CUNNINGHAM:	Okay.	What is16 happening, first of all, as far as the change --   in17 this one building and other buildings that I  have18 been working with, many of these units that  were19 operated by tourists and corporate people and  are20 no longer operated. They immediately are21 deregulated when that person leaves.22 SRO units in my building are going 23	for $ 1 , 800 , $ 1 , 825 , $ 2 , 200 a month.	That is24 happening.25 As far as services, what&#39; s24 </td>

For4 instance, the coin operated machines were taken  out5 of the Temporal and a lot of tenants don&#39; t  have6 credit cards to use the new machines or  debit7 cards, to say the least.8 Garbage is no longer collected in9 this building because the Fire Department came  in10 when it was operated as a hotel and said that  it&#39; s11 illegal to keep fire -- to keep garbage pails  by12 the elevators because there was so many,  many13 people in the building.	The building was so over14 crowded so the egress area had to be emptied so   now15 there&#39; s no more garbage pickups.16 As far as service repairs, tenants17 were told that they must submit their repairs  by18 computer.	Most of us don&#39; t have computers, things19 like that.	It&#39; s not only happening in this20 building, it&#39; s happening in other buildings too.21 But I -- I wanted to tell you  that22 the rents now are very high in these buildings  once23 the tourists leave and, also, there&#39; s a lot of24 warehousing.25 I hope that answers your  question.2 </td>

Most unusual.	When the inspectors come,9 violations are resolved, including the elevator10 that doesn&#39; t work which is very serious.11 Tenants are not doing the12 activism.

On top of this, the  most12 reliable indicator of affordability in New  York13 City&#39; s rental housing stock, the rent- to- income14 ratio is, also, extremely grim.15 When over 50 percent of  the16 housing -- households residing in rental  housing17 pay more than one- third of their income in gross18 rent, the highest margin since the City has  been19 tracking the statistic, it is clear to me that  we20 have a serious affordability crisis on our  hand.21 When you couple this affordability22 crisis with a stagnating unemployment rate and  the23 extremely uncertain short- term repercussions from24 the global economy that stem from the  sovereign25 debt crisis in the Euro Zone, the only  responsible2 </td>

TREPPER:	My name is Melvin19 Trepper.20 I own a 16 - family building in21 Chelsea section of Manhattan and a 20 - family22 building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. I&#39; ve23 owned the Chelsea building since 1979 and  the24 Bushwick since 1989 .25 I want to start by saying that I&#39; m2 </td>

I&#39; m on a first4 name basis with about 90 to 95 percent of  them.5 I want to first just,  briefly,6 talk about rents and expenses.	I know that people7 here a lot of times focus on Manhattan and how   high8 the rents are.	And they are high, particularly, on9 a free market basis.10 But that&#39; s not true of the other11 boroughs.	There are four other boroughs.	For12 example, my Chelsea building -- my  Bushwick13 building, the average rent is $ 871 . 50 per month.14 And that&#39; s the average apartment is15 three- and- a- half rooms.	So I don&#39; t think that&#39; s16 high by anyone&#39; s standard.17 However, when it comes to18 expenses, the expenses on a per unit basis  are19 higher in Brooklyn than they are  in Manhattan.	For20 example, the water and sewer in Brooklyn is $ 1 , 08621 per unit, per year.	In Manhattan, it&#39; s $ 622 per22 unit, per year.	That&#39; s a difference of 75 percent.23 With other expenses it&#39; s not as24 great.	But there&#39; s, typically, when it comes to25 repairs, when it comes to replacement,  maybe2 </td>

They&#39; re also higher outside of3 Manhattan.4 So owners are getting, in  effect,5 hit both ways; lower rents and higher  expenses.6 The last thing I want to touch  on7 is that the system works to the disadvantage  of8 both tenants and landlords.	For example, if you&#39; re9 a responsible owner and you provide heat,  you10 provide services, you -- you make replacements on  a11 timely basis, you replace a refrigerator or a   stove12 and you keep the building in good appearance,  what13 happens?	You have a low turnover rate.	And as a14 result, you have a very low -- a much lower   income15 than if you weren&#39; t responsible.16 So what I&#39; m asking for is that for17 long- term tenants, the people who that have been18 there for a long time, there&#39; s some additional19 income increase for those tenants.20 Just one other example is that  in21 my Chelsea building, the tenants that have  been22 there ten years or more, it was 56 percent and   in23 the Bushwick building it&#39; s 55 percent.	So I&#39; m24 responsible.	I take care of the buildings and  I25 have pride in the ownership.2 </td>
