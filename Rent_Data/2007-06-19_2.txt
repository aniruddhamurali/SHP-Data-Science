Since the sale was completed we have8 noticed some disturbing developments. Hundreds of9 our rent stabilized neighbors have received10 notices of non-renewals when it comes time to11 renew their leases.12 We understand the landlord&#39; s desire13 to remove illegal tenants. However, this practice14 of sending these letters to a broad selection of15 legal rent stabilized tenants is disconcerting.16 Residents must spend time to answer a baseless17 allegation and in some cases, tenants are required18 to hire an attorney to protect their right.19 We are also seeing a noticeable20 turnover of the market rate apartments. In all 11021 buildings of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper22 Village, we see new tenants move in only to move23 out when faced with a lease renewal rate somewhere24 between 20 and 30 percent of their market rate25 rent.</td>

Worked here, basically7 lived here all my life .8 Working families like my parents,9 myself and many others have built this City into10 what it is today but now are in danger of being11 priced out of their apartments and made to feel12 unwelcome in their homes in their own City.13 I don&#39;t want to move out of my14 neighborhood as a result of unaffordable rent15 increases .	Iam now on a fixed income with a cost16 of living raise in the two percent area while17 landlords are asking for raises and increases to18 rents in the five to seven percent range is hardly19 an equitable arrangement .20 Landlords cite the increase in the21 cost of heating fuel as a valid reason for large22 increases in rents.

At a time when our4 economy is generally strong, there is no excuse5 for the fact that New Yorkers who are working6 harder than ever - holding down one, two, even7 three jobs - are nevertheless unable to afford a8 decent apartment for themselves and their9 families.10 In 1970, the average tenant11 household paid 20 percent of its income in rent in12 New York City. In 2005, that figure was 36.713 percent.	Over 26 percent of all tenant households14 dedicate over half of their income just to pay the15 rent. Meanwhile, the cost of living keeps going up16 and wages do not keep pace.17 This situation is unacceptable and18 seriously threatens the future of our City .	There19 are simply not enough affordable housing in the20 City, and every time we hike up rents, we&#39; re left21 with even less.	We cannot stand idly by as the22 gap between rent and income continues to grow.23 Our middle and lower income New24 Yorkers cannot afford to live here and we will25 start to lose our workforce and our middle class</td>

Indeed, those who live in New York&#39; s11 one million rent-regulated apartments are a12 reflection of the City as a whole :	Two-thirds of13 tenants in rent regulated apartments live outside14 of Manhattan.	More than 60 percent have a15 minority head of household, and a quarter have a16 head of household who is 55 or older.17 It is essential that the Rent18 Guidelines Board acknowledge the affordable19 housing crisis when deciding whether the rents of20 a million in our City will go up again, and if so,21 by how much.22 I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that23 New York&#39; s landlords don&#39;t have the right to make24 a profit on their property.

We must work hard12 together to reclaim the waterfront, build over13 unused railroads, and think creatively about our14 potential housing sites.15 We must also use creative zoning and16 land use tools such as inclusionary zoning to17 increase the stock of affordable housing.

Only10 lobbying.11 The total expansion is going to cost12 $7 billion. There&#39;s some countries that are13 running on less than $7 billion. But Columbia14 University is spending $7 billion of probably -15 and I don&#39;t have the figures in my head - but it16 must be public money on this instead of what the17 people of Northern Manhattan need which is18 housing, schools and a decent place to live.19 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.20 MS.

I visit them in their homes, in their14 buildings. I go to the Housing Court with them. I15 have a pretty good sense of what&#39; s going on in the16 community as far tenants.17 The Section 8 standard is supposed18 to be 30 percent of income for rent. And I see a19 lot of people that are paying closer to 80 or in20 excess. It&#39;s amazing how people are able to21 stretch a dollar.22 And the subsidies that are23 available, PREPS (phonetic) has a sunset.	It24 lasts about five years.

HSP is phased4 out for people that are coming out of shelters. It5 doesn&#39; t exist anymore. I just called today.6 Public assistance is inadequate.7 Section 8, as we know, is closed.	So what are8 people supposed to do? People are in dire9 circumstances. They have to choose between paying10 for medicine, school expenses, food, basic11 utilities. It&#39;s a hard calculation for people.12 And people who are in extreme13 hardship forces them into a situation of super14 high occupancy, homelessness or skipping on15 essentials.	And we balance this against landlords16 for whom, you know, the rent increases or small17 adjustments in their profit margin.

Working class people in5 certain sections, I guess whatever the hidden6 agendas are, are laid out for certain groups of7 people to stay here.	But for the most part, it8 seems like the rich are beginning to pick out9 their spots and cultivate.10 My basic question is, what does this11 Board stand for if not for those who it was set up12 for?	Because the rich don&#39;t really need a meeting13 like this. The poor people do. And I want to know14 a simple answer, what do you stand for? Because15 other than saying no more rent increases, you16 really are supporting the rich.17 And it just comes out.	But we go18 through this elaborate thing of having a certain19 amount of time for people to come out and speak20 their piece, to show the symbolic gestures of what21 this Board can prevent or what it will allow to22 happen.23 And I am a person who is sensible24 and is willing to listen and not judge a person on25 face value, but see what they say.

But let me read it.3 In addition to my oral testimony I4 would like to add that there is currently taking5 place in Harlem and Hamilton Heights, a deliberate6 change in complexion of the community which puts7 money in the pocket of the developer .8 The very last property that is9 affordable in the hands of a few developers who10 are trying to	the very last property that is11 affordable is in the hands of a few developers who12 manipulate the system for their benefit.13 Landlords are given tax breaks when14 they purchase buildings in low rent areas and they15 simultaneously get grants from DHCR to make16 improvements.17 DHCR and HPD do not have cross18 referencing so that developers can provide19 inconsistent and/or false information to one or20 the other or both agencies and thus double dip.21 The result is the displacement of22 thousands of New York City families.
