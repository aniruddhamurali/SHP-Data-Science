LANGUEDOC:	Are you saying 18 85 percent of the units of a building or 85   percent 19 of the tenants residing in a  building?20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	I think if 21 you look at the -- I&#39; ll read the example.22 Mr. Languedoc, would you like me 23 to read it?

LANGUEDOC:	Yes, please.4 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Sure.5 The Board&#39; s intention for the 6 meaning of this proviso is that all dwelling  units 7 in the hotel, whether occupied, vacant, rented  to 8 tourists, transients, contract clients, students or 9 other non- permanent tenants, or to permanent rent 10 stabilized tenants, be counted in the  denominator 11 of the calculation.12 The only type of units in  the 13 hotel that may be excluded from the denominator  are 14 units that are used as stores or for  similar 15 business purposes such as doctor&#39; s offices.16 The numerator of the calculation 17 is the number of units occupied by permanent  rent 18 stabilized or rent controlled tenants.19 Here are two examples:	One hotel 20 has 100 units and two stores. Thirty- two units are 21 rented to permanent rent stabilized tenants.	Ten 22 are vacant and 58 are rented to transients  and 23 tourists. The calculation is as  follows:24 The denominator is 100 and  the 25 numerator is 32 .	This calculation results in an 2 </td>

Eight are rented to 8 tourists.	Five are vacant and 135 are occupied  by 9 permanent rent stabilized tenants.10 The denominator would be 148  and 11 the numerator would be 135 .12 This calculation results in an 13 occupancy percentage greater than 85 percent  under 14 the formula ( 91 percent) and an increase can  be 15 taken for the permanent stabilized tenants.16 Does that answer your question,17 Mr. Languedoc?18 MR.
