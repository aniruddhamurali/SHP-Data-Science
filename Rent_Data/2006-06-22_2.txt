As I see it,3 they want us to leave so they can change the4 character of the building to make big profits.5 Now, about my own personal6 situation.	The Social Security Administration7 has determined that I am disabled because of a8 serious heart condition so I receive SSI and food9 stamps benefits currently. A rent increase would10 not be easy for me.11 Now, I&#39;d like to say a few things of12 my own views about the tenant/landlord situation13 in my own, sometimes simple language.14 I ask what&#39;s a matter with these15 landlords?	With all the money they own, they16 still trouble and harass many of their fellow17 citizens who are tenants and have much less so18 that these landlords can gain still more dollars19 for themselves.20 Now I say, it is sickness. It is21 anti- social behavior.	It goes against living in22 harmony with their brothers and sisters.	I say23 it is addiction and there should be24 rehabilitation programs set up for landlords.25 (Audience participation.)2 </td>

We have to15 maintain the building and we lost a lot of income16 due to making regular repairs such as for the17 plumbing.18 In 2004 plumbing had a good year.19 We paid 2,700 to repair plumbing.	2005 we had a20 bad year, $11,600 to repair plumbing.

Last month the price of crude4 oil hit an all time high of $74.38 a barrel.5 Yesterday, the price of crude oil6 closed at $70.33 a barrel.	That is a 700 percent7 increase, 700 percent.	To put this kind of8 increase in perspective, imagine if a tenant&#39;s9 rent increased by the same percentage as crude10 oil.11 For example, if a tenant who was12 paying 500 a month in 1998, had his rent13 increased by the same percentage as the rise in14 the price of crude oil, that tenant would be15 paying $3,500 today.	That shows you just how16 dramatic the percentage increase in crude oil17 really is.18 The rise in the price of crude oil19 has been nothing short of horrific.

Well, what he did, what happens19 is that when he said his landlord actually wants20 to kill him, he wasn&#39; t kidding, because21 management is extremely hostile towards him22 because he sought counsel and advice in order to23 be able to live in the hotel as a permanent24 tenant, which is his right.25 Instead of charging 60, $70 a night12 </td>

So to clarify that.9	So what&#39; s happening in many SRO10	buildings is there they&#39;re called single rooms so11	the landlord sees an opportunity to make huge12 sums of money renting to tourists.	It&#39;s13 important to understand that landlords under no14 realistic estimate, rent illegally to tourists to15 keep up with rising expenses. And in no way could16 raising SRO tenants rent, even 100 percent,17 compensate greedy landlords enough from them to18 stop renting to tourists.19 So therefore, in essence, SRO20 landlords do not need nor care about a rent21 increase.	An increase only places an unfair22 burden on the SRO tenants who mostly live below23 the poverty line, around 48 percent.24 So why does the Board care about the25 problem of illegal hotels in deciding on a rent12 </td>

And also we a have8 list of only sixteen possible SRO hotels that9	rent to permanent tenants .	Ten of those are10 rented to tourists so there&#39;s a problem affecting11 not only the minority of SRO tenants, but the12 majority.13 In addition - - that is why it&#39;s14 greatly important that any provisos must be15 raised to not reward any landlords that are16 warehousing apartments or are renting to tourists17 instead of 75 percent, we should consider very18 seriously 85 percent .19 Thank you very much .20 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	85 you said?21 Thank you .22 (Audience participation .)23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	John Ackerman;24 Followed by Lawrence Gregory;25 Followed by Steven Chabra .10 </td>
