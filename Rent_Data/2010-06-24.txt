As Chair and a public member,  I3 recognize the importance of considering all  the 4 housing data presented to this board by the  Rent 5 Guidelines Board staff, housing experts and 6 government agencies.7 Serious consideration is also 8 given to public testimony of tenants, owners  and 9 public officials, which I believe helps the  board 10 realize the issues faced by those affected by  the 11 decisions of this board.	Each group brings valued 12 concerns and arguments before us. Therefore, I  find 13 it necessary to balance the needs of both  tenants 14 and owners when setting renewal lease  adjustments.15 In analyzing data presented to 16 this board, it is clear to me that costs related   to 17 running multi- family buildings have risen in the 18 past year.	In particular, owners have witnessed 19 double digit increases in real estate taxes  and 20 water and sewer rates. I also acknowledge  that 21 significant factors such as high unemployment  rates 22 and stagnant wages have impacted tenantsâ  abilities 23 to pay their rents.
