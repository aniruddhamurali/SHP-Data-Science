DHCR will prosecute.

I think it &#39;s important to look6 within that especially when we look at  core7 Manhattan and compare it to what &#39;s happening in8 the rest of the City.9 In core Manhattan  it &#39; s true net10 income was up. According to the studies that  the11	staff did in the boroughs, it was down. So it &#39;s12 already starting to  shrink.13 I think it &#39;s a very troublesome14 sign for the industry as a whole as we look  at15 the core price index climbing.16 For those reasons I will  vote17 against the zero.18 (Audience participation. )19CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Call the20question.21The vote is zero across  the22board.23Mr. Carmody?24MR.
