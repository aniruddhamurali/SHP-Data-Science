Led by3 signif icant fuel price increases and high4 property taxes, apartment owners&#39; expenses  have5 cont inued to grow while rents rose only modestly.6 The RGB&#39; s Income and Expense7 Study shows that owner expenses increased by  12.68 percent this year.9 This past year owners of pre-10 1960 buildings faced unprecedented  costs to11 attempt to comply with the City&#39; s new lead paint12 law. From notif ication, tracking, recordkeeping,13 inspection,  testing  and abatement , owner&#39; s14 responsibilities  come with a great expense.

The  small4 building owners are being discouraged saying  that5 the rent increases aren&#39; t keeping up with their6 expense levels. Is your constituency  feeling7 pressure to sell their buildings to converters   to8 get them out of the rent stabilizat ion laws, to9 become co- ops or condominiums?10 MR. JIMMY SILBER:	The11 composit ion of our membership  is basically people12 who live in their own buildings. Most of us  have13 inherited our buildings. So we&#39;ve been there  for14 years. They are our homes, they are our   families&#39;15 homes.16 And we are not speculators17 trying to make a lot of money in real estat e and18 then move on to something  else.19 But what we&#39; re finding - - what20 I &#39;m  finding out is that people my age , who are  in21 their 40s and 50s, who are now gett ing into their22 upper years, are not thinking of leaving  their23 buildings to their children.

And in some sect ions20 owners don&#39; t collect the stabilized increases.21 Rents are at market. They can&#39;t get any  more.2 2	But there are plenty of  areas23 where the rents are so low that a 3  percent24 increase on a $200 apartment is  virtually25 worthless to the owner also.

The Board issued on May 2 ,  200518 a prel iminary version of the Income and Expense19 Study .20 Among its findings is that  the21 average owner net operating income had  declined22 by 4.5 percent.

This places an   enormous15 publ ic policy on the Board.16 How can the Board respond  to17 this unprecedent ed situation? Your deliberations18 as a regulatory body must address the  larger19 economic environment and not impose a clamp   on20 rates in the face of such a dire economic  result.21 A clamp on rates in this context means  the22 setting of any rates which do not reflect  the23 actual increased expenses experienced by  an24 agency.25 It is not in anyone&#39; s interest ,9 </td>

Somebody had just told  me14 there&#39; s been a lot of reshuffling down there and15 maybe  that &#39; s one of the reasons.16 But in the meantime these17 elderly people and vulnerable people have to  keep18 paying increase upon increase. And maybe if  you19 peopl e would l ike to help us and see what you20 could do for these people to see that the  process21 is being speeded up.22 I also understand that Betsy23 Gotbaum, our Public Advocat e , is trying to24 promote some type of legislation to speed up  this25 process. You know, it&#39; s very, very important .</td>
