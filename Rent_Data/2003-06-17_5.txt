This is for people  that11 bring home $600 every two weeks.  Okay?12 And with 5.5 and 8.5 percent13 increases, they can&#39;t afford their rents now.

It was   very12 unjust what they did to me and my family. I   have13 a fifteen- year old daught er, I have a mentally14 ill brother and eighty- one year old aunt.15 And I was in my bed and my  aunt16 was in the hospital and my brother was at his   day17 treatment program. And the marshals came  and18 literally put us in the hall and locked us  out.19 And one more thing. You know,20 the panelists are appointed. You know, we  the21 people , you know, should be doing the  appointing22 or the electing. I mean I really hope  you&#39;re23 listening to us.24 (Audience part icipation.)25 MS.

If it &#39;s wet9 outside, it &#39;s wet inside.10 And these people are  getting11 astronomical amounts of money from the  City.12 Now if this City is broke  and13 they are laying people off , where is HRA  finding14 all of this money to give one, two or  three15 people that own so much  property?16 So it&#39; s only a few that &#39;s17 getting the wealth.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	You need to -1920 MS.
