ALLEN WEINSTEIN:	Probably -- I6 had a fire about 15 years so I gave some tenants a7 preferential rate 15 years ago .	So if their legal8 rent is $936, their preferential rate may be like9 $906. It&#39;s not a big deal to me and I still keep10 it at the preferential rate when I raise by the11 new increases .12 So the preferential rate issue to me13 is a non-factor. I don&#39;t understand your question14 about preferential rate. Why is that important?15 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Well, the16 question is whether - - or the reason it&#39;s17 important is we only can do a certain thing.	If18 you can&#39;t get the preferential rate, and what19 you 1 re testifying to is you probably could for the20 $30, but it&#39;s only $30 and you&#39;re keeping it21 there.22 MR.

The10 truth is the high rents that the tenants are11 paying and the lack affordable apartments and  the12 lack of viable neighborhoods is a self-fulfilling13 prophecy.14 In the mid 1940s when rent control15 went from the National OPA to each state16 legislature, the state legislators up in Albany17 had a tough, tough, tough political decision to18 make . Should they do what is in the best , long19 term interest of the health of the City and state20 of New York or should they prostitute  themselves21 and do what will guarantee their own  re-election.22 Being politicians, they did what23 guaranteed their own re-election.

And finally when the horse learned9 how not to eat, then suddenly he died and the10 farmer said, oh, such a good horse.	Now that he11 became such good, he died.12 So that&#39;s the situation with us. And13 what happens is that you are creating a system14 where there are two tiers of rent.

If somebody dies, they hide it from the20 owner and they bring somebody else and they don&#39;t21 tell the owner.22 Everybody thinks that the owner has23 incentive to harass the tenants.

MELVIN TREPPER:	- - and three in3 Brooklyn in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.4 And I&#39;d like to speak how expenses5 disproportionately effect small owners and6 particularly small owners in walk-up buildings . I7 want to cite a few examples.8 I have a superintendent for all the9 buildings .	They&#39;re part time superintendents .10 They go to the building two or three times a week.11 They clean the hall, they take care of the12 garbage .	They check on various things in the13 boiler and then they leave .14 I get DEP violations on a regular15 basis which large owners don&#39;t get because they16 have a doorman, they have porters, they have17 people that are watching out for them. And all18 small owners get these violations.19 I just want to give you one example20 which happened a few weeks ago.21 I got a violation which stated that22 the inspector saw lids on the garbage cans that23 were not on them properly and so there was the24 potential for the garbage to fall out onto the25 sidewalk.	So there wasn&#39;t even trash on the3 </td>

I got a $100 violation for that.4 So that&#39;s one example where small5 owners are disproportionately impacted by these6 kind of regulations.7 Another - - and that goes across the8 Board in a certain respect is that when you talk9 about heat, it cost more to heat a small building10 on a per unit basis, that is a per square foot11 basis or a per room basis, than it does a large12 building because the boilers are less efficient.13 It&#39;s an older building typically. The same thing14 applies to insurance, repairs, and you can go on15 with every single item.16 So what you have then is you have a17 squeeze. You get lower rents in a walk-up building18 and you have higher per unit expenses. So when you19 give us a four percent or a whatever increase, on20 a $500 or $600 rent, it doesn&#39;t compensate for it21 particularly when you have announced increases of22 eleven-and-a-half percent for water, taxes go up23 on a regular basis, fuel, you know what happens to24 it, refrigerators, whatever it is, impacts the25 small owner more than it does the large owners.

Mostly they&#39;re single or10 couples . The cost for water there is $356 per11 apartment per year.

And the10 Assemblymember urges you in the strongest possible11 terms to reject the rent increase proposals this12 year.13 Year after year, the Rent Guidelines14 Board has determined in favor of landlords,15 granting them higher and higher rents on16 stabilized apartments.	Even if the increases are17 small or the increases are large, there seems18 always to be an increase.19 No one denies that operating costs20 for landlords have risen and these are important21 to take into account when determining whether  or22 not a rent increase is justified .

This will add a new sinister14 meaning to the word water boarding.15 More seriously, I note that when a16 tenant&#39;s income rises beyond a certain point, that17 tenant &#39;s apartment can be removed from rent18 regulation. But tenant&#39;s incomes are often19 volatile.	And while one&#39;s income may rise above a20 certain point for a number of years it may then21 fall below that point for the next years.22 When that happens, there should be a23 procedure for restoring the apartment to rent24 regulation.

There are 261 units in the SRO that is18 the Dexter House.19 So because of the management that is20 full of harassments and evicting people with a lot21 of harassment and a lot of unlawful evictions,22 they now have 90 rooms.

And that amounts to about 4	$216,000, $216,000 per month.5 Now those same 90 rooms would be on6 the average of about $500 per month, okay. So $5007 times 90 is $45,000 per month. So the building is8 really making $216,000 a month on 90 rooms that9 are worth $45,000 a month.10 Now, that to me - - I just want to11 say that this 80 percent proviso is really12 important.	So when the building now of 261 units,13 80 - - we&#39;re below that so we don&#39;t get a rent14 increase now.	But we hope that that will stay15 intact because take a small building, even a16 townhouse that has like 20 units, if they&#39;re17 renting even three of those as hotel rooms, none18 of those tenants need to be paying rent .

It&#39;s just an assumption I5 would make. So I assume it&#39;s pretty synonymous in6 that sense.7 I want to bring up two things: One,8 the fact that I pay $25 a month in my rent, added9 to my rent to -- for the air conditioning. Of10 course, air conditioning is used basically say two11 months or something like that. But it&#39;s - - it&#39;s12 about $300 a year.	Maybe it went down a little13 bit, up a little bit .

They&#39;ll tell you that12 it&#39;s about 24 to 30 - - on the books it will be $3013 for a summer.	You don&#39;t have to trust their14 numbers, of course. But if you look at many15 websites that were - - with computations by state16 agencies and other states, you &#39;ll find that the17 numbers are approximately that amount, $30, $40,18 doesn&#39;t even get up to $50 for an entire summer.19 And on the one hand we&#39;re talking20 about rooms, small rooms . And it gets very,	very21 hot obviously in New York City. And if you&#39;re in a22 room rather than in an apartment, you can&#39;t do23 cross-ventilation.

It&#39;s not a3 luxury, it&#39;s a necessity.4 And the amount of electrical use5 that you have for a room is much less obviously6 than an apartment.	Now, the charge that they give7 of $300 a year for air conditioners they say is8 per room.	So they&#39;ll claim that, in other words,9 somebody who has an apartment with two bedrooms or10 whatever, three or four rooms, will be using three11 or four air conditioners.	I don&#39;t - - I don&#39;t12 believe that there&#39;s anybody charging and paying13 $1,200 a year extra for air conditioners.	Maybe14 they have only one and they cool off the whole15 house with it .16 In any case, the bottom line is that17 it&#39;s totally unfair to charge $300 for the18 electrical usage of an air conditioner in a  room19 when probably it doesn&#39;t go beyond $30 or $40 for20 the usage.	So that extra $260 or whatever21 dollars, are an unfair surcharge to many people22 who really, really need this and probably can&#39;t23 afford, you know, that amount.24 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	And is that the25 nature -- your letter to DHCR is about that2 </td>

The16 state guideline -- the answer to the letter is17 always the same that the state is authorized us to18 charge $300 therefore there&#39;s no need for  a19 meeting. That&#39;s what they say. In other words, we20 decided and screw you basically.21 So the point is somebody has to make22 a calculation of how much it costs and somebody23 has to then pass some kind of regulation saying24 that if you live in a room rather than an25 apartment, you know, that this calculation  applies7 </td>

I support tenants in their10 call for provisos to be included in the guidelines11 that would prohibit a landlord from obtaining a12 rent increase in certain situations such as when13 hazardous violations exists or when the landlord14 has not registered a rent stabilized apartment15 with the New York State Division of Housing and16 Community Renewal as is required by law.17 The Rent Guidelines Board can be18 part of the problem or part of the solution. The19 Board can project these increases an enact20 provisos that help the tenants stay in their rent21 stabilized apartment or it can allow unreasonable22 and unfair increases that will create  further23 financial hardships for tenants and add to the24 affordable housing crisis.25 I believe the choice is easy.

They&#39;re11 saying that they&#39;re upgrading their apartments and12 they&#39;re not using the amount of money that they13 claim they&#39;re supposed to use in order to take it14 out of rent stabilization.15 And so they&#39;re not just the16 Mitchell -Lama that were in there before are not17 the only ones that are being affected by this.18 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	How long have19 you lived there?20 MS .

The number of families living in10 over-crowded situations has nearly doubled with11 10.2 percent of all rental housing considered12 overcrowded.13 The average number of families14 receiving temporary shelter each night has15 increased.	This year, the Rent Guidelines Board&#39;s16 response to these alarming statistics is to17 propose increases of between 2.0 and 4.5 percent18 for one-year renewal leases and between 4.0 and19 7.5 percent for two-year renewal leases.20 I urge you to reconsider . The21 residents of this City cannot continue to pay more22 and more of their incomes in rent. The median23 share of income New York City renters spent on24 rent in 2005 was 31.2 percent, over the 30 percent25 federal benchmark of affordability. And that 1 s not2 </td>

The median household6 income for rent-stabilized households was $32,0007 in 2004, representing a nearly nine percent8 decrease since 2001 .	That means that the average9 rent-stabilized household should pay no more than10 $800 per month in rent in order for the rent to be11 affordable . Yet, in 2005, the average12 rent-stabilized rent was $844 - an over eight13 percent increase since 2002.14 So the incomes of rent-stabilized15 households are going down and the rents are going16 up.	Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but rent increases yet17 again this year in the face of such statistics18 seems contrary to the goal of rent stabilization.19 The negative impact of high rent20 increases does not end with the current tenant.21 Each high increase also reduces the potential of22 the apartment remaining rent stabilized in the23 future.

Like on the low end of the income there9 should be greater increases, and on the - - not the10 income.	The low end of the rental rents should11 have a higher increase	and the higher rents12 should have a lower increase.
