        <td id="LC10" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">2 I would also like to register  my3 opposition to any attempt to impose a so- called4 longevity tax . Rent regulation is an important5 tool to help tenants remain in their homes in  the6 face of rising rents. Punishing these people  who7 have struggled to maintain their homes for  eight8 or more years will destabilize our  neighborhoods9 by uprooting long- term tenants.10 Such a surcharge is a tax  on11 senior citizens and others who have managed  to12 remain in long- term affordable housing against13 increasing odds against them .14 I am pleased that the Board15 voted down this surcharge at its last meet ing and16 I urge the Board not to include a longevity  tax17 in its final recommendat ion .18 All this is not to say  that19 costs for property owners have declined. Over  the20 past three years the Price Index of  Operating21 Costs has gone up. But certainly property  taxes22 represent a large portion, twenty percent , of the23 operat ing cost of rent - stabilized buildings in24 the City. It is the single largest operating  cost25 and typically exceeds the cost of labor and  fuel .2 </td>

For example, instead of8 selling public land at these exorbitant  prices,9 which brings in dollars, I think we have to  make10 some consideration there in terms of being  able11 to allow land for less cost and  enabling12 developers to be able to develop, and that  lowers13 their rate also.14 We need to look at some of  the15 other regulat ions around, you know, the J- 5116 programs and other kinds of subsidies, because  as17 we look at , that has always been in place, even18 with the Mitchell - Lama.
