So that will be happening.8 Any comments, changes and additions9 should be submitted to the staff by June 25th if10 you &#39;d like to make that.11 We&#39;re going to call, as we always do12 at the hearings, alternating owner representatives13 and tenant testifiers and we will also, as soon as14 practical, take testimony from elected officials .15 I would also point out that at this16 point we&#39;re starting the hearing without any of17 tenant reps present, but we want to make sure18 everybody gets a chance to speak and doesn &#39;t have19 too long a time.20 It&#39;s now 4:20.21 The first speaker is Angel22 Villavicencio, Vani Realty Corp .23 Mr. Villavicencio.24 Hold on.

And7 I think there&#39; s no distinction.	I don&#39;t know why8 you find out - - why you think that SRO tenants9 should get slower rent increases than regular10 tenants. The cost to me is the same.11 My property tax is $30,000 a year12 for 16 units. My heat bill is the same regardless13 of how my building is configured. The water bill14 is the same. The maintenance is the same. Pest15 control is the same. There&#39;s absolutely no reason16 to give lower increases for SRO tenants than for17 apartment tenants because it&#39;s the same cost to18 the owner. So the rents should be increased the19 same way. Whatever percentage you decided, it20 should be increased the same way.21 And percentages - - actually in my22 opinion, percentage is not enough. It should be a23 dollar amount. If my property tax went up by24 $3,000 last year, it should be divided by 16 and25 the minimum increase should be that much .2 </td>

Landlords have10 been doing very well .

And we&#39;ve17 interviewed hundreds of families and close to half18 of those families are there because the rents were19 too high.	And those are tenants that are corning20 mostly from rent stabilized apartments.21 And the cost to the City in terms of22 homelessness is great .

The interesting13 thing about using demolition as a weapon is that14 DHCR says it&#39;s just fine to evict tenants who have15 done nothing to warrant eviction and nothing has16 to be demolished.
