It is not fair to tenants this year  to14 have to shoulder the entire burden of bailing  our15 City out. It is not fair for the owners to  pass16 all of their increased costs on to the backs  of17 tenants on top of all the other increases  that18 they have to sustain.19 So I would ask that the public20 members vote against this mot ion.
