A stove  costs16 approximately $8 monthly . Air conditioning a $18017 monthly for twelve months .18 All these additional charges  are19 added on to your base rent. And whenever the  RGB20 authorizes an increase, they are part of our  base21 rent and include it.22 Oh, by the way! Roof  renovation23 and new windows are considered MCis and  assessed24 to your base rent forever . Is this fair?25 Everything is considered an MCI .2 </td>

Let hotel tenants move to  regular13 apartments on a voluntary basis and have  hotel14 owners subsidize their monthly rents .15 If a hotel tenant is presently16 paying $400 a month in rent and moves to a  $90017 apartment , I would be willing to pay the $500 a18 month difference on a permanent basis. The  tenant19 wins by getting a larger living space, a  regular20 home with a kitchen, not a hotel room where  they21 cannot cook.22 The City and State get  tax23 income , and tourists are able to then visit this24 City in hotels that are not sold out because  of25 rooms occupied by permanent  tenants.12 </td>

I7 strongly oppose this year&#39;s rent increases  and8 urge that the Board reject  them.9 The SRO rent increase is10 insupportable. As anyone who has witnessed  the11 conditions of most SRO housing knows, it  is12 housing of last resort. For a person with a  low13 income, even a four percent increase could  mean14 the difference between being on the street  or15 being in one own&#39; s room.16 SRO tenants have absorbed  an17 eight percent rent increase in the last  four18 years.  Between	&#39;93 and	&#39; 99 hotel  tenants&#39; average19 income has fallen twenty percent while  landlords&#39;20 real income in rent collections has risen  forty21 percent.22 The Board should not approve  any23 SRO rent increase in order to protect  vulnerable24 housing for those who need it most and who  can25 least afford  to pay more .2 </td>

The10 Board should be enacting a rent freeze this  year11 or at least dramatically scaling back  its12 proposed increases.13 (Audience participation.)14 MR. DAN GOLUB:	In fact , it &#39;s15 long past time to abandon the Price Index.  It16 only reflects changes in prices, not in  actual17 expenditures and it does not take into  account18 the incomes of tenants, and its data on  landland19 income and expenses are outdated by the time  the20 Board votes.21 Because it &#39; s so one- sided , the22 Index is incapable of addressing the  central23 question that the Board should be asking: what  is24 the fairest way of distributing the impact  of25 this recession?

I18 called the police, showed them proof that  I19 requested a lease.20 A month later, the landlord&#39; s21 son, Brandon  Fried , and  a manager,  Rose, made22 accusatory statements alleging that I entered  an23 empty unit and stole a picture.

I&#39;ll give you an example.19 Last week I had an owner call ,20 Hispanic woman, three buildings  in Brooklyn,21 three six-unit buildings.
