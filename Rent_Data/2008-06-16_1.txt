The majority of tenants, they lie.	But it 21 depends on how you will  vote something.	They can 22 never do nothing.23 They mention Tom Duane.	He&#39; s a24 politician.

All these 5 increases in taxes, water and fuel are killing  the 6 small owners. You must reestablish the low  rent 7 adjustment. It is not a poor tax, but  an 8 equalization process.	We all have to share the 9 burden of rising fuel and maintenance costs.  As 10 vendors and others pass increases onto us, we  need 11 to pass some of it onto the  tenants.12 A likely guideline for the  low 13 rent adjustment could be, up to $ 1000 , increased by 14 $ 75 . Rents about $ 1000 would be increased by the 15 guideline. Rent control has a fuel service  charge.16 Perhaps it also can be considered for  rent 17 stabilization for these times.18 Consider a minimum legal regulated 19 rent that could vary by borough.	This is, and will 20 continue to be, the cause of the deterioration  and 21 loss of fine buildings, homelessness and 22 unaffordable housing, mostly in the six  to 23 fifteen- family range.
