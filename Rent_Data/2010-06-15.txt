I know everybody whoâ s12 registered has been given a copy of  them.13 Each speaker will have three 14 minutes from the time his or her name is called   to 15 complete their presentation.	In the event that 16 there is a large number of people that wish  to 17 speak, the Chair may reallocate the time.	It might 18 be shortened, but weâ ll cross that bridge when we 19 come to it.20 Iâ ll try to call several names in 21 advance.

If you actually read the 9 application, it starts at $ 29 , 000 a year, not 10 including several other government benefits, which 11 would tick it up easily into the mid $ 30 , 000 range.12 Nor the utility bills that every relative on  the 13 planet is paying so that they can claim  residency 14 when the primary tenant moves out.15 So letâ s do some real math using 16 the minimum SCRIE eligibility at $ 29 , 000 , assuming 17 the tenants are telling the truth, about half  of 18 their income.	That kicks in under $ 1 , 200 .	So 19 therefore, any rent under $ 1 , 200 , SCRIE would pick 20 up the increases, whether from the board or  the 21 Major Capital Improvements.22 So what is all the fighting  about?23 SCRIE will pay for all the Rent Guideline  Board 24 increases, all MCI increases.

They never explain 8 how their rents can be well under 1 , 000 and still 9 not qualify for SCRIE.10 The simple truth is that rents  are 11 so cheap, they do not qualify for this very  simple 12 program.13 I have plenty of SCRIE 14 applications.	And contrary to the $ 1 . 50 that the 15 building received in 1972 , SCRIE will pay thousands 16 of dollars annually for truly needy  tenants.17 In 1969 the average rent was $ 400 18 in Manhattan, yet 41 years later we are  still 19 discussing $ 400 rents.	Okay?20 A subway fare in 1969 was 20  cents 21 and a ham sandwich was 40 cents at  Woolworths.22 Itâ s been a very long time since weâ ve had that.23 And I really donâ t think itâ s fair to have tenants 24 that are paying their fair share paying for  tenants 25 who got these super cheap rents.2 </td>

ANDERSON:	Hi. I prepared 10 this in letter form.	So -- weâ ll agree that some 11 rents in the City are  too high.	It is just as 12 wrong that 25 percent or many rents are  too low.	I13 live in a 16 - unit co- op with full rent stabilized 14 apartments and one rent controlled apartment.	The 15 rents are slightly more than half the cost of  the 16 maintenance.	This means that the landlord  unfairly 17 pays for people to live on his  property.18 The rent control and rent 19 stabilization system keeps rent artificially low 20 over the course of years. Rents that are too  low 21 create an injustice that one individual,  the 22 landlord, without his consent, is forced to pay  the 23 living expenses of another individual, the  renter.24 In other words, tenants are living off  landlords.25 Due to this injustice my  small 2 </td>

Weâ re not just losing money, we are 5 falling behind on our expenses.	Many of us small 6 landlords are forced to work two jobs and  are 7 forced to have both parents work in order to  make 8 up the difference. Is this fair to our  children?9 Not to mine.10 Why does the City treat  all 11 landlords the same? Do you treat the small  bodega 12 at the corner the same way you treat a   large 13 supermarket chain such as Pathmark?	The City 14 unfairly treats small landlords according to  the 15 same standards as large landlords. Small  landlords 16 are being forced to sell out.	Many are converting 17 their two or four- family home into just a18 one- family home. Why is there a housing shortage?19 Maybe the shortage is due to the injustice  of 20 inequitable rent laws and regulations.21 The City is one of the  largest 22 offenders of raising the cost of living to such  a23 high level. The City has raised property taxes  and 24 water costs so high that they take up to 40   percent 25 of the cost of running a building. This 40   percent 2 </td>

So itâ s7 actually a little more than 25  percent.8 Given all these long term 9 injustices, namely the inequitable rent  laws,10 increasing property taxes and water costs, it  is 11 time for the City to be courageous enough  to 12 overhaul the rent control and rent  stabilized 13 system, both of which are 50 to 80 years out   of 14 date and both of which no longer meet the needs   of 15 the City.16 They not only no longer meet  the 17 needs of the City, they fail to meet the needs   of 18 the City.

And I address all of my  tenants 8 concerns within, you know, a reasonable time  frame.9 This year my property tax  was 10 increased by 13 . 8 percent and I donâ t know what 11 next year will bring.

And 16 they project that that rate will increase  by 17 another 11 . 5 percent in July of 2011 . This is the 18 fourth consecutive rate, double digit increase  to 19 the water rate.20 In addition to these fixed  costs,21 thereâ s always unexpected costs that come up.	For 22 example, my boiler and hot water heater broke  down 23 in January and I had to spend thousands of  dollars 24 repairing it.

So I cannot continue to improve  the 7 quality of my building without a fair  guideline 8 increase this year.9 I realize that this is  tough 10 economy and, you know, itâ s a tough time.

Weâ re getting squeezed every which way and 21 most specifically by the City and  government 22 agencies. Weâ re expected to pay increases in our 23 real estate taxes, water, sewer, payroll.	Yet we 24 arenâ t compensated for these increased costs with 25 comparable increases in the annual guideline.2 </td>

Yet, it doesnâ t measure the 5 frequency of that cost.	For instance, a new 6 building or building built even 20 year ago  does 7 not need to replace pipes in a building as old   as 8 mine, which is 80 years  old.9 Last month, for example, we had  a10 leak in the living room of a first floor  apartment.11 We ended up breaking the walls and the  ceilings 12 from the basement, from the cellar, all the way  up 13 to the top of the third floor bathroom. Itâ s on  a14 six- story building, to change all of the hot and 15 cold risers. The job cost $ 5 , 200 and I attached it 16 to my testimony. I havenâ t paid it yet  though.17 So you could see this  for 18 yourself.	This doesnâ t even include closing up all 19 the holes and repainting all these rooms,  the 20 walls, the ceilings, which will probably  add 21 another $ 4 , 000 to the job.	And we only changed the 22 risers halfway up. And this is just one example  of 23 what we face everyday. Some things can be  deferred.24 Some cannot.	Rotted, leaking pipes cannot be 25 deferred.	If we had enough resources, we  would 2 </td>

Weâ ll have to put a mortgage on the 14 building to pay for this.	But how many mortgages 15 can we put on the building?

The lower rent 20 adjustments started to address the inequities  of 21 the clear imbalance in rents in  my buildings.

One of the buildings I  manage 23 downtown, this yearâ s tax bill will be $ 722 , 936 .24 Thatâ s 82 units available for rent.

Itâ s going to fill in the hole from 9 apartments whose rents are so low that the taxes  on 10 the buildings are ridiculously low also.11 So what we have at this  point 12 between the low rent increases that have been  given 13 out over the years, youâ ve stopped reaching into 14 the landlordsâ pockets and picking them clean  and 15 youâ ve reached through to the second half of 16 tenants to make up for the difference.
