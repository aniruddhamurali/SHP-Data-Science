ELIZABETH GARDNER:	Last year 12 I testified and told you about the $ 404 , 000 major 13 capital improvements increase that is, major 14 capital improvements in quotes, that our  landlord 15 petitioned to the Division of Housing and  Community 16 renewal.17 He wanted $ 27 . 05 per room per 18 month. Now, I want to note here that the   building 19 has 58 units.	Five are rent controlled, 49  are 20 rent stabilized and two are market rent. And  the 21 other two I don&#39; t know. One is vacant and the  other 22 one, I think somebody moved into but I&#39; m not  sure 23 what its status is.24 In other words, meaning $ 54 . 10 per 25 month for studios, in which I live,  I live.	$ 81 . 15 2 </td>

He told the 8 Department of Buildings that he was going to  do 9 $ 1 , 010 , 000 worth of work on our building and then 10 he later filed papers with DCHR saying it  was 11 $ 404 , 000 .

And 20 he even told DHCR that the roof grew not once   but 21 twice from 10 , 400 square feet to 11 , 000 square and 22 then again to 11 , 400 square feet.23 Now, why is he doing that?

Water rates have increased twice and  my 4 taxes jumped more than $ 8 , 000 .

In my house, such increases on renewal  leases 10 will not even cover the jump in fuel costs that   we 11 face this winter.12 Operating costs are out of 13 control. Heat, water, insurance and taxes are  well 14 outpacing rent increases. But the Board  must 15 address not only this year&#39; s issues but also the 16 fact that last year&#39; s increases shortchanged owners 17 and failed to provide crucial and needed long- term 18 tenancy adjustments.19 In my house, three one- bedroom 20 apartments that have been occupied for thirty  years 21 or more have rents between $ 611 and $ 660 . Under 22 last year&#39; s guidelines, these tenants all signed 23 two year leases in early 2008 . Their rents 24 increased just $ 35 to $ 38 per month.

Currently you, the RGB,11 holds the key to maintaining this  affordable 12 housing, at least until your November  reelection.13 In 1979 I began looking not for  an 14 apartment, but a home, albeit a rental.

You. Give us your name.16 MS. JOANNE JOVINELLY:	My name is 17 Joanne Jovinelly, J- o- v- i- n- e- l- l- y.18 And live in the East Village  on 19 11 th Street and First Avenue. I&#39; ve lived there 20 since 2000 . I was very fortunate to get  the 21 apartment.22 When I moved there, my rent  was 23 roughly around 850 . Now it&#39; s over $ 1400 a month. I24 work as a book editor in the publishing  industry,25 which as you know, is centered here in New York.   I2 </td>

But to put that burden just to  the 5 lower and middle classes, the people who  really 6 want to strive to stay in the City that they   love,7 is particularly unfair.8 I understand that rent increases,9 that&#39; s just a matter of course especially here in 10 Manhattan and all the five boroughs.	But please 11 consider the lowest possible increase this  year.12 Anymore money I cannot -- I mean I&#39; m a woman  so 13 obviously my rent -- I mean my ability to   earn 14 money is going to be capped out at a certain   point,15 especially in the publishing industry where a  lot 16 of the workers who were once staffers with  full 17 benefits have now been forced to take  freelance 18 jobs with no benefits and no health  insurance.19 That&#39; s where I am right now after 20 working ten years in the same place. I lost my   job 21 in 2006 at Christmas and I&#39; ve since only been  able 22 to employed as a  contractor.23 Now the money&#39; s good but I haven&#39; t24 been paying taxes for a while so I&#39; m going to  get 25 hit up very soon.2 </td>

And when I asked my 4 landlord to make repairs in the building,  which 5 were extensive, I was told that I signed the   lease 6 in an as- is condition.	Like I said, my rent  has 7 gone up quite a bit. I&#39; m now paying $ 1406 and 8 change a month. It&#39; s still affordable to me  but 9 very soon it will no longer  be.10 And for me to get work  in 11 publishing I would have to commute an  extremely 12 long distance back here to the City which  I13 probably couldn&#39; t afford to do either. If I  went 14 back home to New Jersey and my situation is  not 15 much better. And there are no jobs there. I   love 16 this city. I want to stay here for as long as   I17 can.18 I don&#39; t have a family. I couldn&#39; t19 possibly think of having a family with the  prices 20 the way they are right now. So just me   supporting 21 myself with any more rent increases it&#39; s just going 22 to be impossible.23 CHAIRMAN MARKUS:	Thank you.24 ( Applause.)25 MS. HOLDER:	Thank you.2 </td>
