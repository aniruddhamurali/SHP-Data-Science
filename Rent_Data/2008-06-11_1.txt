CHIP 3 is concerned that the preliminary guidelines do  not 4 reflect the economic reality of owning  rental 5 property in New York.	This concern has four parts:6 The first concerns the cumulative 7 effect of years of guidelines below the  PIOC.8 The second concerns the unique 9 aspects of the energy environment.10 The third addresses tax 11 situations.12 And the fourth addresses the  need 13 to set some rent support mechanisms in  certain 14 circumstances.15 It has been the practice of  the 16 Board to issue a Price Index of Operating Costs  and 17 then to retreat significantly from such numbers  to 18 set the guidelines.	This guarantees that rents19 will not keep pace with the actual cost  of 20 operating buildings.21 Specifically, the Board&#39; s PIOCs 22 for the years, the five years, 2004 through 2008 ,23 show an actual increase in costs to  operating 24 property of 38 percent.

There is conclusive evidence that we  have 10 entered a period of expensive  energy.11 According to the Federal Energy 12 Information Agency, in the ten- year period from 13 1998 through the beginning of this year, fuel  oil 14 prices have accelerated from 31 cents a gallon  to 15 $ 3 . 20 a gallon.16 This is a 1 , 000 percent increase 17 over the period.18 The RGB and its PIOCs, if you  take 19 the fuel component compounded that over the  same 20 period, you get 367 percent, of which, of  course,21 you only recognize, in the guideline, about  half.22 So that&#39; s 180 percent.23 So this is -- this is quite  a24 mismatch.

So it&#39; s quite a mismatch.4 Energy expenditures, as I&#39; m sure 5 you&#39; re aware, are essentially non- discretionary to 6 the owner for a few  reasons.7 First, the service has to  be 8 provided.9 And secondly, shopping for price 10 differentials typically has no effect.	And, of 11 course, you know, conservation, to the extent  that 12 it happens, is in the hands of the end user   and 13 there&#39; s no relationship between the end user and 14 the cost of the energy.15 Onto taxes, which present a16 special consideration.17 Twenty- seven percent of all the 18 expenses, according to your data, they&#39; re the 19 single largest cost in operating a  building.20 In this regard, I think it&#39; s21 important to recognize that in this regard  the 22 owner is simply acting as a collection agent  for 23 the City.

My dad bought his first building  in 15 1959 and I&#39; ve been in charge of the day- to- day 16 operation of our real estate business for the  past 17 fourteen years.18 I know that many landlords  will 19 discuss surging costs for energy, water, and  real 20 estate taxes.	But I&#39; ve come to testify about 21 something else - the long- term tenant discount.22 We landlords come here year  after 23 year to ask about relief from the long- term tenant 24 discount and almost every year the Board  does 25 nothing.2 </td>

The average rent for the two rent  controlled 10 apartments is actually higher.

And without passing a minimum  rent 14 increase this year of at least $ 50 for a one- year 15 lease and $ 75 for a two- year lease, these tenants 16 will fall further behind.17 Last heating season, the heating 18 oil for this building cost $ 70 , 964 or $ 1478 per 19 apartment.
