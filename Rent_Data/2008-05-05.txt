The vast majority of landlords  have 5 been suffering the cost increases of real  estate 6 taxes, insurance, fuel oil, labor and services  for 7 years without commensurate increases in  rent.8 These landlords are the 9 gatekeepers of the existing affordable  housing 10 stock. These gatekeepers are the private  citizens 11 that the City has forced to shoulder a public  cost,12 with higher real estate taxes, water and  sewer 13 charges and now obscenely high fuel  costs.14 The tenants must share the  burden 15 of these cost increases. And the continuing  cost 16 increases on top of last year&#39; s cost increase on 17 top of the prior years increase on top of  prior 18 years increase in operating costs must be  shared.19 The Board&#39; s own calculation show 20 2008 commensurate rent increases averaging well 21 higher than last year&#39; s increases.22 Landlords ask us, what can  the 23 Board do to help keep our properties from  ruin?24 We&#39; ve seen the staff reports that show the 25 increased trend in distressed housing and it&#39; s2 </td>

But it is a one- size- fit all approach.3 I would like to also just add  that 4 to the extent of what my colleague Steven said,  the 5 Income and Expense Study of 2008 , which does work 6 with 2007 information, showed that the  landlords&#39;7 net operating income increased by 8 . 8 percent from 8 2005 until 2006 .	And net operating income is  the 9 amount landlords have left over after paying  all 10 the costs of operation and  maintenance.11 So what we see is that from  2000 12 -- it went up 35 . 1 percent in 2005 , 36 . 7 percent in 13 2006 .	And again, what landlords are seeing is  37 14 cents for debt service and profit. This is  more 15 than a decent return.16 Now, to the extent that there&#39; s17 hardships, the same way that my colleague  Magda 18 says that there are a lot of options out there   for 19 tenants, I say there are a lot of programs and   ways 20 in which landlords who are suffering can also  have 21 their suffering addressed.22 ( Audience participation.)23 MS.

But we all know that the first quarter  of 18 2008 has been devastating to everyone who lives  in 19 New York City.20 We have seen a  significant 21 downward trend in our economy here.
