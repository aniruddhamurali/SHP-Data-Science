As13 borne out of the studies this year, the  current14 recession, even though we think we&#39; re at the end of15 the recession, has hurt all stratas of New  Yorkers,16 except for property owners.17 The Income and Affordability Study18 shows that wages continue to fall.

That&#39; s20 in direct contrast to the Income and Expense  Study,21 which shows that owners&#39; net operating  income22 continues to grow.23 In addition, Housing and Community24 Renewal told us that not one, not one  property25 owner applied for a hardship increase in 2012 .2 </td>

But tens of10 thousands of tenants do it every year because  they11 need to.12 Let&#39; s also remember the testimony13 of people like Anita Romm, June Mac Millan and14 dozens of other tenants who told us that  rent15 increases would be forcing them to choose  between16 paying their rent and paying basic  expenses.17 Let&#39; s remember Fitzroy Christian,18 who said while he was retired, he can&#39; t enjoy his19 retirement because he pays 67 percent of his  income20 towards rent.
