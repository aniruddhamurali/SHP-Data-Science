SCHLEIDER:	But what was6 missing this year was testimony from  Borough7 Presidents, State Legislators, City Councilmembers8 regarding their efforts to produce more  affordable9 housing.	The elected officials all cited the  weak10 economy and the burden that rents place on  some11 tenants - no solutions to the day- to- day problems12 maintaining the physical health of aging  rental13 housing stock.	No solutions to the long- term14 problem of capital investment to preserve  the15 rental housing stock.16 The elected officials only cite17 the weak economy and the burden that rents place  on18 some tenants.	They all call for a zero  rent19 increase just this one time but this  deceptively20 simple one- shot deal would complicate a difficult21 situation.22 So how do we get to a  generally23 affordable rent increase?

Almost 7014 percent of New Yorkers rent their housing  and15 approximately 45 percent of renter households  in16 New York City are rent stabilized with a  vacancy17 rate of 2 . 63 percent.18 These rent stabilized renters and19 their families have a median household income  of20 $ 37 , 000 a year and a median gross rent of $ 1 , 160 .21 Rent stabilized renters and their families endure  a22 median gross rent to income ratio of 35 . 2 percent 23	in 2011 .24 The 2011 Housing Vacancy Survey25 reported that rent stabilized tenants are  theROY ALLEN &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., 212-840-1167100 Church Street, 8th floor, New York, New York 1000756</td>
