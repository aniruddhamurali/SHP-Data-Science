And if the data  that19 was presented to us justifies increases because  the20 cost of managing and operating those units  warrant21 an increase, then it should be proper to impose  an22 increase for these tenants.23 And to argue, as you do,  that24 those increased costs should be made up by  market25 rents only serves to inflate market  rents2 </td>
