And each 12 year there have been different spreads between  the 13 one- and two- year lease renewals that have been 14 passed by the board. And I don&#39; t know recall  that 15 there&#39; s been any discussion as to the reasoning 16 behind those spreads.17 Certainly from my point of view,  I18 think that the higher the spread the more  incentive 19 there is for tenants to sign a one- year renewal,20 and -- which is probably not advantageous  to 21 tenants.	And I would like that the board   would 22 look this over in the next period between now  and 23 the final vote as to what is an appropriate  spread 24 between a one- and a two- year renewal lease, you 25 know, keeping in mind that, you know, assuming  the 2 </td>
