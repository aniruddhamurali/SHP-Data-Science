So think about this when we think6 about how we go forward.7 When you consider the following8 issues, such as deregulation, it has long been9 argued that owners who deliberately deprive10 themselves of additional rents by withholding11 units from the market should not complain that12 existing rents are insufficient to earn an13 adequate return on their investment and as a14 result, have been denied annual rent increases.15 Similarly, residential hotels in16 which the majority of the units are used as17 commercial hotel rooms, have been denied rent18 increases based on the financial well being the19 commercial units provided.20 Likewise, if an owner has21 deregulated the majority of the units in his22 building, the new market rent apartment should23 produce a return on the original investment that24 is more than adequate.	As a result, such25 buildings should not receive annual rent increases</td>
